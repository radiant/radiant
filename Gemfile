# This is the minimum of dependency required to run 
# the radiant instance generator, which is (normally)
# the only time the radiant gem functions as an 
# application. The instance has its own Gemfile, which
# requires radiant and therefore pulls in every 
# dependency mentioned in radiant.gemspec.

# When radiant is installed as a gem you can run all of
# its tests and specs from an instance. If you're working
# on radiant itself and you want to run specs from the 
# radiant root directory, uncomment the lines below and
# run `bundle install`.
