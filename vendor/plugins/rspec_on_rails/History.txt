=== In Development (git clone git://github.com/dchelimsky/rspec-rails.git)

IMPORTANT: use 'script/autospec' (or just 'autospec' if you have the rspec gem
installed) instead of 'autotest'. We changed the way autotest discovers rspec
so the autotest executable won't automatically load rspec anymore. This allows
rspec to live side by side other spec frameworks without always co-opting
autotest through autotest's discovery mechanism.

* Add conditional so Rails 2.1.0 doesn't warn about cache_template_extensions (patch from James Herdman)
* Fixed stub_model examples to work with Rails 2.1.0 (the code was fine, just the examples needed patching)
* use hoe for build/release
* reworked generated examples for rspec_scaffold - thanks to Mikel Lindsaar and Dan Manges for their feedback
* bye, bye translator
* Added proxy to cookies so you can set them in examples the same way you set them in controllers
* Added script/autospec so you can run autospec without installing the gem
* Support --skip-fixture in the rspec_model generator (patches from Alex Tomlins and Niels Ganser)
