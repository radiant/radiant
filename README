== Welcome to Radiant

Radiant is a no-fluff, open source content management system designed for
small teams. It is similar to Textpattern or MovableType, but is a general
purpose content management system (not just a blogging engine).

Radiant features:

* An elegant user interface
* The ability to arrange pages in a hierarchy
* Flexible templating with layouts, snippets, page parts, and a custom tagging
  language (Radius: http://radius.rubyforge.org)
* A simple user management/permissions system
* Support for Markdown and Textile as well as traditional HTML (it's easy to
  create other filters)
* An advanced plugin system
* Operates in two modes: dev and production depending on the URL
* A caching system which expires pages every 5 minutes
* Built using Ruby on Rails
* And much more...
