    link: "Renders a link to the page. When used as a single tag it uses the page's title
      for the link name. When used as a double tag the part in between both tags will
      be used as the link text. The link tag passes all attributes over to the HTML
      @a@ tag. This is very useful for passing attributes like the @class@ attribute
      or @id@ attribute. If the @anchor@ attribute is passed to the tag it will
      append a pound sign (<code>#</code>) followed by the value of the attribute to
      the @href@ attribute of the HTML @a@ tag--effectively making an HTML anchor."
      
    breadcrumbs: "Renders a trail of breadcrumbs to the current page. The separator attribute
      specifies the HTML fragment that is inserted between each of the breadcrumbs. By
      default it is set to @>@. The boolean nolinks attribute can be specified to render
      breadcrumbs in plain text, without any links (useful when generating title tag)."
